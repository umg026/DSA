11. Given an array of integers, find the longest consecutive sequence.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9], Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

12. Write a function to find the minimum element in an array.

Example: Input: [5, 3, 8, 2, 1], Output: 1

13. Given an array of integers, find the number of elements that are greater than a given element.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x = 3, Output: 2 (elements 4 and 5 are greater than 3)

14. Write a function to find the median of an array.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Output: 3

15. Given an array of integers, find the first element that is not equal to its index.

Example: Input: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], Output: 4 (index 4 has value 4, but index 0 has value 0)

16. Write a function to find the maximum product of two elements in an array.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], Output: 20 (product of 4 and 5)

17. Given an array of integers, find the number of elements that are less than a given element.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], x = 3, Output: 2 (elements 1 and 2 are less than 3)

18. Write a function to find the longest subarray with a given sum.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], sum = 9, Output: [2, 3, 4]

19. Given an array of integers, find the first element that appears only once.

Example: Input: [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4],
