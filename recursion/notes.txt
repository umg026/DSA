What is a Recursive Function?
A recursive function is a function that calls itself somewhere within the body of the function. Below is a basic example of a recursive function.

function recursiveFunc() {
  recursiveFunc()
}

The Three Parts of a Recursive Function 

Every time you write a recursive function, three elements must be present. They are:

*The function definition.
*The base condition.
*The recursive call.

==========
What is a base condition?
When using a recursive function, the base condition is what lets the function know when to stop calling itself. Once the base condition is met, the recursion ends.
if we dont add any base condition the it gone infinity loop.

function recursiveFunc() {
  if(base condition) {
    // stops recursion if condition is met
  }
  // else recursion continues
  recurse();
}
